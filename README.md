# No Token Panning

Prevent Foundry VTT from automatically panning when tokens move offscreen.

## About

When using a screen controlled by a module such as [Lock View](https://github.com/MaterialFoundry/LockView) for in-person gaming, you generally don't want the canvas to move unless *you* move it.

By default, Foundry VTT pans the canvas whenever a controlled token moves offscreen.

This module disables that behaviour.

## Installation

Either search for and install this module within Foundry VTT, or copy this address into the `Manifest URL` bar:

```

This module uses [LibWrapper](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/lib-wrapper).
